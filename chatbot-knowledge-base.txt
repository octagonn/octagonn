## IT Best Practices

### How often should I back up my data?
We recommend daily automated backups for all critical business data. For optimal protection, follow the 3-2-1 backup rule: maintain 3 copies of your data, on 2 different types of media, with 1 copy stored off-site or in the cloud.

Different data may require different backup frequencies:
- Critical business data: Multiple times daily
- Standard operational data: Daily
- Less critical archival data: Weekly or monthly

The backup schedule should be determined by how much data you can afford to lose in a disaster scenario (your Recovery Point Objective or RPO).

### What's the difference between backup and disaster recovery?
Backup is simply making copies of your data, while disaster recovery is a comprehensive plan to restore business operations after a disruptive event. Disaster recovery includes backup but also covers hardware replacement, alternative work locations, communication plans, and defined procedures for restoring critical systems in a specific order. Effective disaster recovery requires regular testing and updating of your plan.

### How often should I update my software?
Critical security updates should be applied as soon as possible after testing. For feature updates, we recommend a scheduled approach that balances getting new capabilities with ensuring system stability.

We recommend the following update cadence:
- Critical security patches: Within 1-2 weeks after testing
- Operating system updates: Monthly, after testing
- Application updates: Quarterly, or as major versions are released
- Firmware updates: Semi-annually for critical infrastructure

### Should I automatically apply all updates?
No, we don't recommend automatically applying all updates without testing. While security updates are important, some updates can cause compatibility issues with your specific applications or workflows. We recommend testing updates in a controlled environment before deploying them across your organization. For managed services clients, we handle this testing and rollout process.

### How do I establish an effective IT lifecycle management program?
An effective IT lifecycle management program includes:
1. Asset inventory with detailed documentation
2. Performance monitoring to identify aging systems
3. Regular evaluation of hardware against current requirements
4. Budgeting for regular refreshes (typically 3-5 years for computers)
5. Standardization of equipment where possible
6. Proper disposal of outdated equipment including data wiping
7. Strategic planning for major system upgrades

This approach prevents the accumulation of outdated technology and spreads renewal costs more evenly across budget cycles.

### What password practices do you recommend?
We recommend:
- Using unique passwords for each account
- Creating complex passwords with a minimum of 12 characters
- Using a password manager to store and generate passwords
- Implementing multi-factor authentication wherever possible
- Changing passwords every 90 days
- Never sharing passwords between employees

### What is multi-factor authentication and why is it important?
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds a layer of security beyond passwords by requiring additional verification such as a code from a mobile app, a text message, or a biometric verification like a fingerprint. MFA is critical because even if a password is compromised, attackers still can't access your accounts without the second factor. We strongly recommend implementing MFA for all business applications, especially email, cloud services, and financial systems.

### How can I protect my business from cyberattacks?
Essential cybersecurity measures include:
- Keeping all software updated
- Using strong, unique passwords
- Implementing multi-factor authentication
- Training employees on security awareness
- Using business-grade firewall and antivirus protection
- Backing up data regularly
- Having an incident response plan
